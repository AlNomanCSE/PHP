# 🍎 PHP Array Iteration Examples

This project demonstrates various ways to iterate over an indexed array in PHP using different loop constructs.

## 📦 Example Array

```php
$fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
```

## 🔍 Print the Array Structure

```php
echo "Indexed Array: ";
print_r($fruits);
```

Output:
```
Indexed Array: Array ( [0] => apple [1] => banana [2] => orange )
```

---

## 🔁 Looping Through the Array

### 1. `foreach` Loop (Recommended for Arrays)

```php
foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
    echo $fruit . "<br>";
}
```

> ✅ Best practice for simple array iteration.

---

### 2. `for` Loop (Index-based)

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < count($fruits); $i++) {
    echo $fruits[$i] . "<br>";
}
```

> ⚠️ Efficient if you need index control.

---

### 3. `while` Loop

```php
$i = 0;
while ($i < count($fruits)) {
    echo $fruits[$i] . "<br>";
    $i++;
}
```

> ✅ Good when looping based on dynamic conditions.

---

### 4. `do...while` Loop

```php
$i = 0;
do {
    echo $fruits[$i] . "<br>";
    $i++;
} while ($i < count($fruits));
```

> ⚠️ Always runs at least once — useful in specific scenarios.

---

### 5. Functional Style with `array_map`

```php
array_map(function($fruit) {
    echo $fruit . "<br>";
}, $fruits);
```

> 🧪 Great for applying functions to each element.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use `foreach` unless you specifically need index access.
- Avoid calling `count()` inside loop conditions repeatedly — store it in a variable first.
- Add `<br>` tags only when outputting HTML in web environments.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- PHP 7.0 or higher
- Web server (optional, for HTML output)
